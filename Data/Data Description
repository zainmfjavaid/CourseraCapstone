The data I am using to train this model is an excel file with about 180,000 lines of data. The data contains roughly 47 attributes surrounding weather conditions,
number of vehicles involved, traffic conditions, and severity which is the metric surrounding how bad an accident is. This severity column is what we are 
attempting to predict, thus, this is now a supervised learning problem.
