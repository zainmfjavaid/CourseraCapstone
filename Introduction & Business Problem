The purpose of this project is to be able to predict car accident severity based on a number of conditions specified with a dataset of accidents. 
The goal of the project is to be able to input a number of weather and traffic conditions into the model and have an output of how bad an accident is 
likely to be on that specific day. This project could easily help with car accident previntion although it has a wide variety of use cases beyond this.
